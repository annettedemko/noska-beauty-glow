# Vercel Domain Configuration Guide

## Problem: 307 Temporary Redirect (www ‚Üî non-www)

Currently, the domain redirects with **307 Temporary Redirect**, which is **bad for SEO**.

```
www.pmu-noska.de ‚Üí pmu-noska.de (307)
```

**Why this is a problem:**
- ‚ùå Google may index both versions (duplicate content)
- ‚ùå Link juice is not passed efficiently
- ‚ùå PageRank is split between versions
- ‚ùå Analytics data is fragmented

**Solution:** Configure **301 Permanent Redirect** in Vercel Dashboard

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Login to Vercel Dashboard
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

### 2. Select Your Project
Navigate to: `noska-beauty-glow` project

### 3. Go to Domain Settings
Click: **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**

### 4. Configure Primary Domain

You should see:
```
‚úì pmu-noska.de
‚úì www.pmu-noska.de
```

**Action Required:**
- Set `pmu-noska.de` as **Primary Domain** (no www)
- `www.pmu-noska.de` should show "Redirects to pmu-noska.de"

### 5. Verify Redirect Type

After configuration, test with curl:

```bash
curl -I https://www.pmu-noska.de
```

**Expected response:**
```
HTTP/2 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://pmu-noska.de/
```

**NOT this:**
```
HTTP/2 307 Temporary Redirect  ‚ùå
```

## üéØ Recommended Domain Structure

**Primary Domain (Canonical)**:
```
https://pmu-noska.de
```

**All these should redirect to primary**:
```
http://pmu-noska.de         ‚Üí https://pmu-noska.de (301)
http://www.pmu-noska.de     ‚Üí https://pmu-noska.de (301)
https://www.pmu-noska.de    ‚Üí https://pmu-noska.de (301)
```

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: Both domains are indexed in Google
**Symptom**:
```
site:pmu-noska.de
site:www.pmu-noska.de
```
Both show results.

**Fix**:
1. Set up 301 redirects (above)
2. Submit both URLs to Google Search Console
3. Set preferred domain in GSC
4. Request re-indexing

### Issue 2: 307 instead of 301
**Symptom**: Redirect works but uses 307

**Fix**:
- Must be configured in Vercel Dashboard (not vercel.json)
- vercel.json doesn't support www redirects

### Issue 3: Mixed content (some links use www)
**Symptom**: Internal links point to www version

**Fix**:
- Canonical tags already set correctly (SEOHead.tsx)
- Sitemap uses correct URLs (sitemap.xml)
- No action needed (redirects will handle it)

---

## üìä After Configuration

### Update Google Search Console
1. Add both domains as properties:
   - https://pmu-noska.de
   - https://www.pmu-noska.de

2. Verify both domains

3. Set `https://pmu-noska.de` as **preferred domain**

4. Check Coverage report:
   - All www URLs should show as "Redirected"
   - All non-www URLs should show as "Indexed"

### Update Sitemap
Already correct! Sitemap only references non-www:
```xml
<loc>https://pmu-noska.de/</loc>
```

### Update robots.txt
Already correct! Only references non-www:
```
Sitemap: https://pmu-noska.de/sitemap.xml
```
